[Assignment](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html) from week 2 of [Princeton's Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) Course on Coursera.
# Deque
A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. The implemantion used a doubly linked list approach.

# Randomized queue
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure. It was used a resizing array approach to the implementation.

# Permutation Client
Created to test the implementation of the randomized queue. It takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of n strings and prints exactl k of them, uniformly at random.

### Built With

The library [alg4.jar](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) from the course was used.
